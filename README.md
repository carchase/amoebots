# AmoeBots
Senior Capstone Project August 2016 to May 2017

## Background
A senior project group in ECE has been creating a robot array consisting of
several modular units that can reconfigure themselves into a wide variety of
possible arrangements. Ideally, the robots would be able to form (for
example): a bridge, stairs, a wall, etc. These robots will communicate with
each other using a well-known protocol such as wifi or Bluetooth.
However, their artificial intelligence still needs to be programmed. Coming up
with a possible shape to transform into is relatively easy, but actually coming
up with a step-by-step plan so that the robot modules can move into place
without any human assistance, is a more difficult AI problem. The CS senior
design team will create such algorithms, by first developing a simulation
platform for transformations, then implementing them on actual modular bots.
In addition to working with Dr. Licato, the CS senior design team will work
with the ECE senior design groups in a first-ever collaboration between
departments of its type at IPFW.

Progress made in this project will be used as a launching point for at least one
external funding proposal to be written by Dr. Licato, in collaboration with
other ETCS Faculty (Drs. PomalzaARaez (ECE), Liu (ECE), and Bi (ME)). The
robotics projects and code completed by the CS and ECE senior project teams
will be used in future robotics courses here at IPFW.
